# Monitor Helper
Utility for managing computer monitors. This code has only ever been tested with [Python 3](https://www.python.org), [Microsoft Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10), and a [Lenovo Y27q-20](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd500310-lenovo-y27q-20-monitor-overview) monitor (firmware v1.5).

## Testing
Unless you own diagnostic equipment, it's not really possible to run automated tests. I recommend using [NirSoft ControlMyMonitor](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/control_my_monitor.html) and [softMCCS](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/lib/softmccs.shtm) for manual testing.
